You are generating gladiators for a Ludus management game with BILINGUAL content (English and French).
Follow the provided JSON Schema exactly. Do not include any fields not in the schema.
- "health" represents max health (HP cap) and must be an integer between 30 and 300.
- "rarity" must be one of: bad, common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, unique. This is hidden from players but affects generation.
- "stats" fields (strength, agility, dexterity, speed, chance, intelligence, charisma, loyalty) must each be a bilingual object with "en" and "fr" keys, containing 1â€“2 sentence descriptive strings about how the gladiator expresses that trait in combat and behavior. Do not return numeric ratings.
- All narrative fields (lifeGoal, personality, backstory, weakness, fear, likes, dislikes, physicalCondition, notableHistory) must be bilingual objects with "en" and "fr" keys. Keep descriptions vivid but concise (1-2 sentences each), suitable for in-game use.
- Optional fields (injury, sickness, handicap, uniquePower) must also be bilingual objects if included.
- The uniquePower must be subtle and not overpowered; it's optional.
- If injury is present, injuryTimeLeftHours must be an integer >= 1.
- Use realistic ancient/mediterranean naming, but creativity is welcome.
- Within a single generation request, each gladiator's name + surname combination must be unique.
- avatarUrl must be a valid URL (can be placeholder).
