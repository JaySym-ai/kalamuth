# Server Isolation Bug Fix - Complete Report

## Problem Summary
The game had a critical data isolation bug where server-specific data (ludus, gladiators, fights, matchmaking) was not properly scoped to the user's currently connected server. This caused cross-server data leakage where users could see or interact with data from servers they weren't currently connected to.

## Root Cause
Several page components were querying the `ludi` table without filtering by the user's `favoriteServerId`, which meant they would return ANY ludus belonging to the user, potentially from a different server than the one they were currently viewing.

## How Server Context Works

### Server Selection Flow
1. **favoriteServerId** is stored in the `users` table and represents the user's currently selected server
2. When users switch servers via `ChangeServerButton`:
   - Updates `favoriteServerId` in the database via `/api/user/favorite-server`
   - Stores `selectedServerId` in sessionStorage
   - Redirects to server-selection or ludus-creation flow
3. Most pages fetch the user's `favoriteServerId` first, then query the ludus for that specific server

### Database Schema
- `users.favoriteServerId` - The server ID the user is currently viewing
- `ludi.serverId` - The server each ludus belongs to
- `gladiators.serverId` - The server each gladiator belongs to
- `combat_queue.serverId` - The server for each queue entry
- `combat_matches.serverId` - The server for each match
- `tavern_gladiators.serverId` - The server for each tavern gladiator

## Fixed Pages

### Pages That Were Missing Server Filters
The following pages were querying ludus WITHOUT filtering by `favoriteServerId`:

1. **app/[locale]/ludus/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).single()`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

2. **app/[locale]/tavern/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).limit(1)`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

3. **app/[locale]/inventory/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).limit(1)`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

4. **app/[locale]/shop/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).limit(1)`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

5. **app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).limit(1)`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

6. **app/[locale]/initial-gladiators/page.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Was using `.eq("userId", user.id).limit(1)`
   - Now filters by `favoriteServerId` with fallback logic

### Standard Server Filter Pattern
All fixed pages now use this pattern:

```typescript
// First, get user's favorite server
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("favoriteServerId")
  .eq("id", user.id)
  .maybeSingle();

const favoriteServerId = userData?.favoriteServerId;

// Fetch ludus from favorite server, or first available ludus if no favorite
let query = supabase
  .from("ludi")
  .select("...")
  .eq("userId", user.id);

if (favoriteServerId) {
  query = query.eq("serverId", favoriteServerId);
}

let ludus = (await query.limit(1).maybeSingle()).data;

if (!ludus) {
  // If we have a favorite server but no ludus there, fall back to any ludus
  if (favoriteServerId) {
    const { data: anyLudus } = await supabase
      .from("ludi")
      .select("...")
      .eq("userId", user.id)
      .limit(1)
      .maybeSingle();

    if (anyLudus) {
      // Use the first available ludus and update favorite server
      await supabase
        .from("users")
        .update({ favoriteServerId: anyLudus.serverId })
        .eq("id", user.id);

      ludus = anyLudus;
    } else {
      redirect(`/${locale}/server-selection`);
    }
  } else {
    redirect(`/${locale}/server-selection`);
  }
}
```

## Already Properly Isolated

### Pages That Were Already Correct
These pages were already filtering by `favoriteServerId`:

1. **app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx** ✅ Already correct
2. **app/[locale]/gladiators/page.tsx** ✅ Already correct
3. **app/[locale]/quests/page.tsx** ✅ Already correct

### API Endpoints With Proper Server Validation

#### Tavern System ✅ Already correct
- **app/api/tavern/recruit/route.ts** (Line 78)
  - Filters tavern gladiator by `serverId` to prevent cross-server recruitment
- **app/api/tavern/next/route.ts** (Line 60)
  - Filters tavern gladiator by `serverId`
- **app/api/tavern/generate/route.ts**
  - Generates gladiators with correct `serverId`
- **app/[locale]/tavern/TavernClient.tsx** (Line 78)
  - Realtime subscription filters by both `ludusId` AND `serverId`

#### Arena/Combat System ✅ Already correct
- **app/api/arena/queue/route.ts**
  - GET endpoint (Lines 32-38): Filters queue by `serverId`
  - POST endpoint (Lines 92-98): Validates gladiator is on the same server
  - Matchmaking (Lines 221-227): Only matches gladiators from same server
- **app/api/combat/match/[matchId]/status/route.ts** (Lines 48-52)
  - Validates all participants are from the same server
- **app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/page.tsx**
  - Fetches queue entries filtered by `serverId` (Lines 73-79)
  - Fetches matches filtered by `serverId` (Lines 94-99)

#### Gladiator System ✅ Already correct
- All gladiator queries filter by `ludusId`, which inherently scopes to the correct server
- Gladiators table has `serverId` column for additional validation

## Server Validation in API Endpoints

### Endpoints With Server Ownership Validation
These endpoints validate that operations are performed on the correct server:

1. **app/api/arena/queue/route.ts** - Validates gladiator.serverId matches requested serverId
2. **app/api/tavern/recruit/route.ts** - Validates tavern gladiator is from correct server
3. **app/api/tavern/next/route.ts** - Validates current gladiator is from correct server
4. **app/api/combat/match/[matchId]/status/route.ts** - Validates all participants are from same server
5. **app/api/ludus/route.ts** - Prevents creating duplicate ludus on same server

### Endpoints That Rely on Ludus Ownership
These endpoints validate ludus ownership, which implicitly validates server context:

1. **app/api/gladiators/start/route.ts** - Validates ludus ownership
2. **app/api/quests/generate/route.ts** - Validates ludus ownership
3. **app/api/quests/accept/route.ts** - Validates quest ownership via ludus
4. **app/api/quests/complete/route.ts** - Validates quest ownership
5. **app/api/quests/cancel/route.ts** - Validates quest ownership
6. **app/api/gladiator/chat/route.ts** - Validates gladiator ownership via ludusId

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps
Use the test accounts on test-server-1:
- test2@hotmail.com / qplsk8hothot
- test3@hotmail.com / qplsk8hothot
- test4@hotmail.com / qplsk8hothot

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Dashboard View**
   - Switch between servers
   - Verify only the current server's ludus is displayed
   - Verify gladiator count matches current server

2. **Tavern Recruitment**
   - Recruit gladiators on test-server-1
   - Switch to another server (if available)
   - Verify recruited gladiators only appear on test-server-1

3. **Arena/Combat Queue**
   - Join arena queue on test-server-1
   - Verify queue only shows gladiators from test-server-1
   - Verify matchmaking only pairs gladiators from same server

4. **Gladiators Page**
   - View gladiators on test-server-1
   - Switch servers
   - Verify gladiator list updates to show only current server's gladiators

5. **Cross-Server Switching**
   - Create ludus on multiple servers (if possible)
   - Switch between servers using ChangeServerButton
   - Verify all pages show correct server's data after switch

### Automated Testing
Consider adding Playwright tests for:
- Server switching flow
- Data isolation verification
- Cross-server operation prevention

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified: 7
1. `lib/ludus/repository.ts` - Added `getCurrentUserLudus()` function for unified server isolation logic
2. `app/[locale]/ludus/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`
3. `app/[locale]/tavern/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`
4. `app/[locale]/inventory/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`
5. `app/[locale]/shop/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`
6. `app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`
7. `app/[locale]/initial-gladiators/page.tsx` - Refactored to use `getCurrentUserLudus()`

### Refactoring Benefits
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated 235+ lines of duplicated server isolation code
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for server isolation logic in `lib/ludus/repository.ts`
- **Consistency**: All pages now use identical server isolation logic
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
- See `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for detailed refactoring documentation

### Files Verified (No Changes Needed): 15+
- All API endpoints with server validation
- All pages already using favoriteServerId filter
- All realtime subscriptions with server filters

## Conclusion

The server isolation bug has been fixed by ensuring all pages that query ludus data filter by the user's `favoriteServerId`. The existing API endpoints already had proper server validation in place. The fix ensures that:

1. ✅ Users only see data from their currently connected server
2. ✅ Tavern recruitment assigns gladiators to the correct server's ludus
3. ✅ Arena queue and matchmaking only show/pair gladiators from the same server
4. ✅ All server-specific operations are properly scoped and validated

The application now properly isolates data by server, preventing any cross-server data leakage.
