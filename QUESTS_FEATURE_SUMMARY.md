# Quests Feature - Complete Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A fully functional quest system for the Kalamuth gladiator management game that allows players to send their gladiators on AI-generated missions with immersive narratives, risk management, and dynamic outcomes.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Quest Generation
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for quest generation
- **Immersive Narratives**: Historically accurate, roleplay-focused quest descriptions
- **Automatic Volunteer Selection**: AI selects the best gladiator based on personality and quest requirements
- **In-Character Messages**: Volunteers provide roleplay messages explaining their motivation

### 2. Quest Mechanics
- **1-Hour Duration**: Each quest takes exactly 1 hour to complete
- **Risk System**: Three risk percentages (0-99%):
  - Danger: Risk of injury
  - Sickness: Risk of contracting illness
  - Death: Risk of gladiator death
- **Reward System**: 1-5 sestertii per quest
- **Cost System**:
  - Reroll: 1 sesterce
  - Cancel: 2 sestertii

### 3. Quest Lifecycle
1. **Generate**: AI creates a new quest
2. **Pending**: Quest awaits acceptance
3. **Active**: Quest in progress (1-hour timer)
4. **Completed/Failed**: Quest finished with results
5. **Cancelled**: User cancelled (costs 2 sestertii)

### 4. Dynamic Outcomes
- **AI-Generated Results**: Narrative description of what happened
- **Health Loss**: Gladiators can lose 0-50 health
- **Injuries**: Can contract injuries with 24-hour recovery
- **Sickness**: Can contract illnesses
- **Death**: Gladiators can die during quests
- **Rewards**: Sestertii added to ludus treasury

## How to Use

### For Players
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Quests" button (⚔️)
3. Click "Generate New Quest"
4. Review quest details, risks, and volunteer message
5. Click "Accept Quest" to start
6. Wait for 1 hour (timer counts down)
7. View results when complete
8. Repeat or check quest history

### For Developers

#### Running the Feature
1. Apply the database migration:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Testing
- Navigate to `/[locale]/quests`
- Generate a quest
- Accept it
- Wait for completion (or check browser console for timer)
- View results

#### Customization
- Modify quest prompts in API endpoints
- Adjust risk percentages in generation logic
- Change reward amounts in database constraints
- Customize UI components in `/components` folder

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **Quests Table**: Stores all quest data with proper constraints
- **RLS Policies**: Users can only see/modify their own quests
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common queries
- **Realtime**: Enabled for live updates

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Validation**: Input validation and type checking
- **Security**: RLS policies + user authentication

### Frontend Architecture
- **Client Component**: React hooks for state management
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase realtime subscriptions
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient API calls with minimal data transfer
- Client-side timer to reduce server load
- Lazy loading of quest history

### Scalability
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Indexed queries for fast retrieval
- Realtime updates for live data

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended
1. **Background Jobs**: Implement cron for automatic quest completion
2. **Quest Chains**: Multi-part quests with storylines
3. **Difficulty Scaling**: Quests scale with ludus reputation
4. **Morale Impact**: Quest outcomes affect ludus morale
5. **Experience System**: Gladiators gain experience from quests

### Optional
1. **Special Quest Types**: Arena prep, training, exploration
2. **Failure Consequences**: Reputation loss on failure
3. **Quest Rewards**: Special items or bonuses
4. **Leaderboards**: Track quest completion stats
5. **Achievements**: Unlock badges for quest milestones

## Known Limitations

1. **Client-Side Timer**: Quest completion is handled client-side
   - Solution: Implement background job for production

2. **No Gladiator Availability**: Gladiators aren't marked unavailable during quests
   - Solution: Add availability flag to gladiators table

3. **No Morale Impact**: Quest outcomes don't affect ludus morale
   - Solution: Add morale update logic to completion endpoint

4. **No Experience System**: Gladiators don't gain experience
   - Solution: Add experience tracking to gladiators

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Quest generation fails**
- Check `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set
- Verify API key is valid
- Check network connectivity

**Timer doesn't work**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh page if stuck

**Results not showing**
- Wait for 1 hour or check timer
- Refresh page to sync with database
- Check Supabase realtime is enabled

### Debug Mode
Add console logs in QuestsClient.tsx to track state changes:
```typescript
console.log('Current quest:', currentQuest);
console.log('All quests:', quests);
```

## Conclusion

The Quests feature is now fully integrated into Kalamuth and ready for use. It provides an immersive, AI-powered experience that adds depth to the gladiator management gameplay while maintaining historical accuracy and roleplay elements.
