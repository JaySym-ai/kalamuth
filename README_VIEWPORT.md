- Is easy to implement on every page

## ✅ What Was Delivered

A complete, production-ready system with:

### 🔧 Components
1. **GameViewport** - Main viewport wrapper that locks scrolling
2. **ScrollableContent** - Helper for scrollable areas within viewport
3. **GameLayout** - All-in-one layout component (easiest to use)

### 📚 Documentation
1. **GAME_VIEWPORT_GUIDE.md** - Complete implementation guide
2. **VIEWPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - What was implemented
3. **VIEWPORT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference card
4. **This README** - Overview and getting started

### 🎨 Global Styles
- Updated `app/globals.css` with viewport-locking styles
- Prevents body/html scrolling

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Import the Component
```tsx
import GameLayout from "@/components/layout/GameLayout";
```

### Step 2: Wrap Your Page
```tsx
export default function YourPage() {
  return (
    <GameLayout>
      <YourContent />
    </GameLayout>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Test on Mobile
- Verify no page scrolling
- Check safe areas respected
- Confirm internal scrolling works (if needed)

**That's it!** 🎉

1. **Start with Quick Reference** (`docs/VIEWPORT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)
   - See common patterns
   - Copy-paste examples
   - 5 minutes to get started

2. **Review Existing Implementations**
   - Check `app/[locale]/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`
   - Check `app/[locale]/combat/[matchId]/page.tsx`
   - See real-world usage

3. **Read Full Guide** (`docs/GAME_VIEWPORT_GUIDE.md`)
   - Understand all patterns
   - Learn migration steps
   - Troubleshooting tips

4. **Migrate Your Pages**
   - Start with high-priority pages
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Use migration checklist

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After migrating a page:

- [ ] Desktop: Page fills viewport, no scrolling
- [ ] Mobile: Page fills viewport, no scrolling
- [ ] iPhone: Safe areas respected (notch, home indicator)
- [ ] Android: Safe areas respected (gesture bar)
- [ ] No pull-to-refresh on mobile
- [ ] No bounce effect on iOS
- [ ] Internal scrollable areas work correctly
- [ ] Touch gestures work in scrollable areas

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. GameViewport is Fixed
- Uses `fixed inset-0` positioning
- Fills 100dvh (dynamic viewport height)
- Handles safe areas automatically

### 2. Backgrounds are Absolute
- Use `absolute inset-0` for backgrounds
- Not `fixed` (GameViewport is already fixed)

### 3. Scrollable Areas Need data-scrollable
- Add `data-scrollable="true"` to enable scrolling
- Allows touch gestures to work properly
- Use `overflow-y-auto` for vertical scrolling

### 4. Content Uses Relative Positioning
- Use `relative z-10` for content layer
- Ensures content appears above background

---

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content is cut off | Add `h-full overflow-y-auto` to container |
| Can't scroll on mobile | Add `data-scrollable="true"` |
| Pull-to-refresh still works | Ensure GameViewport wraps entire page |
| Safe areas not respected | GameViewport handles this automatically |
| Background doesn't fill | Use `absolute inset-0` not `fixed` |

---

## 🎨 Architecture

```
GameViewport (fixed, 100dvh)
├── Background Layer (absolute inset-0)
└── Content Layer (relative z-10)
    ├── Option 1: Fixed Content (h-full flex items-center)
    ├── Option 2: Scrollable Content (h-full overflow-y-auto)
    └── Option 3: Fixed Header + Scrollable Body (flex flex-col)
```
