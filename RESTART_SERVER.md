# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Must Restart the Development Server

The fixes for the combat completion bug have been applied to the code, but **the server is still running the old code**.

## How to Restart

1. **Find the terminal running `npm run dev`**
2. **Press `Ctrl+C`** to stop the server
3. **Run `npm run dev`** again to start with the new code

## Why This is Necessary

The errors you're seeing reference **line 30** in the old code:
```
at sendEvent (app/api/combat/match/[matchId]/start/route.ts:30:22)
```

But in the fixed code, line 30 is now inside a try-catch block with safety checks. The server needs to be restarted to load the new code.

## What Will Be Fixed

After restarting, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Controller is already closed" errors
- ✅ Combat matches complete properly
- ✅ Matches are removed from arena UI after completion
- ✅ New matches can be started immediately

## Test After Restarting

1. Navigate to an arena
2. Start a new combat
3. Watch it complete
4. Verify no errors in server logs
5. Verify the match disappears from the arena UI
