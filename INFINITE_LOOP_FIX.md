# Infinite Loop Fix - Match Acceptance System

## Error

```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, 
but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.

at ArenaDetailClient.useEffect (app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/ArenaDetailClient.tsx:282:7)
```

## Root Cause

The `useEffect` in `ArenaDetailClient.tsx` was updating `activeMatchDetails` whenever `acceptancesData` changed, but it also had `activeMatchDetails` in its dependency array. This created an infinite loop:

1. `acceptancesData` changes
2. `useEffect` runs and updates `activeMatchDetails`
3. `activeMatchDetails` changes
4. `useEffect` runs again (because `activeMatchDetails` is in dependencies)
5. Loop continues infinitely

## Original Code (Broken)

```typescript
// Update match details with latest acceptances
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeMatchDetails && acceptancesData.length > 0) {
    setActiveMatchDetails(prev => prev ? {
      ...prev,
      acceptances: acceptancesData,
    } : null);
  }
}, [acceptancesData, activeMatchDetails]); // ❌ activeMatchDetails causes infinite loop
```

## Solution

The effect was completely unnecessary because we're already passing `acceptancesData` directly to the `MatchAcceptancePanel` component. The solution was to **remove the effect entirely**.

## Fixed Code

```typescript
// Removed the useEffect entirely - not needed!
// acceptancesData is passed directly to MatchAcceptancePanel
```

## Additional Cleanup

Also removed debug logging from both components to improve performance:

### Removed from `ArenaDetailClient.tsx`:
```typescript
// Debug logging for acceptances
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeMatch?.status === "pending_acceptance") {
    console.log('ArenaDetailClient - Acceptances Debug:', { ... });
  }
}, [activeMatch, acceptancesData]);
```

### Removed from `MatchAcceptancePanel.tsx`:
```typescript
// Debug logging
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('MatchAcceptancePanel Debug:', { ... });
}, [acceptances, player?.id, opponent?.id, userAcceptance, opponentAcceptance]);

// Debug logging for button visibility
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Button visibility:', { ... });
}, [isExpired, hasUserResponded, showButtons, userAcceptance]);
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/ArenaDetailClient.tsx`**
   - Removed unnecessary `useEffect` that was causing infinite loop (lines 279-287)
   - Removed debug logging (lines 205-214)

2. **`app/[locale]/arena/[slug]/MatchAcceptancePanel.tsx`**
   - Removed debug logging (lines 87-94, 195-202)

## Testing

After this fix:
1. The infinite loop error should be gone
2. The page should load without console errors
3. The match acceptance panel should still work correctly
4. Performance should be improved (no unnecessary re-renders)

## Why This Happened

The original intent was to keep `activeMatchDetails.acceptances` in sync with the real-time `acceptancesData`. However, this was unnecessary because:

1. `MatchAcceptancePanel` receives `acceptancesData` directly as a prop
2. It doesn't need `activeMatchDetails.acceptances` at all
3. The effect was creating unnecessary state updates

## Lesson Learned

When using `useEffect` with `setState`:
- ✅ Only include dependencies that should **trigger** the effect
- ❌ Don't include state that the effect **updates** (causes infinite loop)
- ✅ Consider if the effect is even necessary (often it's not!)

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Infinite loop resolved, debug logging removed, code cleaned up
